# The Refund Action

_Note_: The refund action code be found [here](https://github.com/Yakuhito/slot-machine/blob/master/puzzles/actions/xchandles/refund.clsp).

This action is very similar to the [CATalog refund action](https://docs.catalog.cat/technical-manual/catalog/the-refund-action), except that the pricing puzzle might either be a 'normal' or 'expiry auction' one. A precommit coin can be clawed back in the following cases:

* The CAT maker puzzle hash has changed
* The payment CAT amount is wrong
* The pricing puzzle in used has changed
* The handle has already been registered

The action also creates a puzzle announcement that be asserted to ensure the dApp singleton is running the right action with the right parameters. For the refund action, the announcement prefix, `$` , is concatenated to `(sha256tree (secret handle . rest_hash)` .
