# The Add Entry Action

_Note_: The add entry action code be found [here](https://github.com/Yakuhito/slot-machine/blob/master/puzzles/actions/reward_distributor/manager/add_entry.clsp).

This action adds an entry to the active entries of the reward distributor. The entry immediately starts earning rewards in the active epoch.

The action does not create a puzzle announcement. Instead, the manager must send a puzzle-puzzle (18) message to the Reward Distributor with the contents of `a`  + `(sha265tree (entry_payout_puzzle_hash . entry_shares))`.
