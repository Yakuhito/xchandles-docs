# Managed Reward Distributor

Initially, reward distributors were only available in the managed mode. This attribute describes how entries are added to the distributor. In this case, an external coin - the singleton manager - sends a message to the reward distributor to add or remove entries at any time. The manager may also set custom distribution weights (shares) to entries. The two actions in this group are _only_ present in the action merkle tree of a managed reward distributor.
