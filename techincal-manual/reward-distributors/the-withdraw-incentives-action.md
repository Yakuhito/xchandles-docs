# The Withdraw Incentives Action

_Note_: The withdraw incentives action code be found [here](https://github.com/Yakuhito/slot-machine/blob/master/puzzles/actions/dig/withdraw_incentives.clsp).

Users that committed incentives to a future epoch can call this action to 'claw back' their commitment. This is done by sending a message from the `clawback_ph` specified when the rewards were committed, which is assumed to be a custody puzzle (hence, the refund will be sent to the same puzzle).

The action does not create a puzzle announcement. Instead, the user must send a puzzle-puzzle (18) message to the Reward Distributor with no contents. If the user has multiple commitments, they should assert that the correct commitment slot is spent - commitment slots are only spent when commitments are clawed back.
