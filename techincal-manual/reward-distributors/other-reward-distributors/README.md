# Other Reward Distributors

The NFT mode of the reward distributor allows anyone holding an NFT (from a particular collection or on a particular curated list) to stake it in order to create an entry. The CAT modes allows anyone to stake a CAT with a particular asset id (set at launch) to the distributor to create an entry with a proportional number of shares. The first two actions in this group are _only_ present in the action merkle tree of an NFT or CAT reward distributor. The third/last action is only available for refreshable curated NFT distributors.
