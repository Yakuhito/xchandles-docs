# XCHandles FAQ

### What is XCHandles?

XCHandles is, at its core, a decentralized address book. Users can register human-friendly handles such as @yakuhito, which can then be associated with an XCH address, profile picture, display name, and much more. XCHandles is the Chia equivalent of the Ethereum Name Service and the first fully decentralized registry of this kind.

### How should I refer to XCHandles?

When speaking, you can refer to XCHandles as "handles" or "X-C-H handles"/"Chia handles" if you consider the other party/parties will not know what blockchain the protocol functions on. In writing (e.g., messages, UIs, etc.), please write "XCHandles". The only exception to the previous code is Rust code, where "Xchandles" may be used to conform to variable naming standards.
